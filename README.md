I decided to give presentations in LaTeX a shot! Working from basically scratch, so definitely a work in progress and once everything is done there will need to be a crazy code cleanup. The basic layout was adapted from [this StackExchange post](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/146529/design-a-custom-beamer-theme-from-scratch) if you want to learn how to make your own. Definitely a good starting point!


Here's a screenshot at the initial phase.
